Excavator Operator Guide

1. Safety First: Always wear your seatbelt and helmet before operating the excavator. Perform a walk-around inspection to check for leaks, loose parts, or hazards.

2. Starting the Machine: Ensure the area is clear. Insert the key and turn to the ON position. Wait for system checks, then start the engine.

3. Controls Overview: The left joystick controls the boom and swing. The right joystick controls the stick and bucket. Use pedals for track movement.

4. Digging: Lower the boom, extend the stick, and curl the bucket to dig. Lift the load smoothly and avoid sudden movements.

5. Loading: Swing the cab to the dump area. Extend the stick and open the bucket to release material. Return to the dig area smoothly.

6. Shutdown: Park on level ground, lower the bucket, idle the engine for 2 minutes, then turn off the machine. Lock the cab and remove the key.

7. Maintenance: Check fluid levels daily. Clean the air filter and inspect tracks for wear. Report any issues to maintenance staff.
